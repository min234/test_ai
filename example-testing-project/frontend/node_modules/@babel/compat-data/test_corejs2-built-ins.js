Given the JavaScript code snippet provided, it appears there is confusion regarding its context. The code you've provided is not Python; instead, it's a CommonJS module export in JavaScript. However, since you've requested a Python `pytest` test file, we'll create a hypothetical test scenario in Python, assuming there's equivalent functionality to test.

```python
# test_module_import.py

import json
import pytest

def test_corejs2_built_ins_import():
    # Assume the JSON file data/corejs2-built-ins.json contains a specific structure.
    # Since we cannot access JavaScript module system, we mimic the behavior in Python.
    try:
        with open("./data/corejs2-built-ins.json", "r") as f:
            data = json.load(f)
        
        # Add assertions based on expected data structure or contents
        assert isinstance(data, dict), "The JSON data should be a dictionary."

    except FileNotFoundError:
        pytest.fail("The file data/corejs2-built-ins.json was not found.")
```

This code snippet is a simple test that checks if a JSON file is correctly loaded and if the data is a dictionary. Adjust it according to the actual structure and content of `corejs2-built-ins.json`.
